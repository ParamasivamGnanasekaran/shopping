**Soliton Shoppin APP**  
Shopping apps are designed to make it easy for customers to find and buy the products they need. They also allow you to purchase items faster by allowing customers to save payment info and make in-app payments by logging into an account.

**Usage**  
 Apps can save you time in checking out, earn rewards, and find coupons and deals. But before you download one, think about the information you share when you use the app, and know how to get help in case of a billing error.
